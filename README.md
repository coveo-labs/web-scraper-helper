Now available from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-scraper-helper-for-co/demelhhhnkocnphihjbhpafjnknknkdf?hl=en-US)

The Coveo Cloud V2 Web and Sitemap source types can use a web scraping configuration to exclude web page sections, extract metadata, and create sub-items for web pages to index (see [Web Scraping Configuration](http://www.coveo.com/go?dest=cloudhelp&lcid=9&context=277)).

The web-scraper-helper works directly in your browser allowing you to easily create and test your web scraping configuration when visiting web site pages requiring web scraping.

## Description

This project started with a [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/) script but was later converted to a Google Chrome extension.

- Google Chrome extension

  It is recommended to use the Chrome extension, as it offers the latest improvements and is simpler to use (see the Chrome extension [README](chrome_extension/README.md)).

- Tampermonkey script

  Use the Tampermonkey script only when you want to go back and customize the early version of the tool (see the Tampermonkey script [README](misc/Tampermonkey/README.md)).
